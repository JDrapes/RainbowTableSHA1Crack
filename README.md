# RainbowTableSHA1Crack
Rainbow table implementation in order to crack SHA1 encryption

PasswordDemo.java is a file where you can just input text and see how it hashes using SHA1.
sha1.java is required as it is called in rainbowTable.java
rainbowTable.java is the main file, here you can build a rainbow table and then enter hashes and attempt to crack the passwords, alter the parameters to alter search space.

Future project improvement could be to improve the reduction function.
